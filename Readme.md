<h2>NOTE TO REVIEWERS:</h2>

<p><strong>Week 2 Reviewer:</strong></p>
<p>The boilerplate file is where the basic styles are going to be in week 2, the application will not be pushed until week 4 so if you are my week 2 reviewer please look in the correct folders before you say that there is not enough to review or some equivalent statement.</p>

<p><strong>Week 3 Reviewer:</strong></p>
<p>Sorry there is not a lot to "see" here yet, the basic file structure has been pushed and the ground work for the navigation has been laid out. Check back in Week 4 to see the final project!</p>
